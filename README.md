# CVE-2024-39929 PoC

## Vulnerability Brief

Exim through 4.97.1 misparses a multiline RFC 2231 header filename, and thus remote attackers can bypass a $mime_filename extension-blocking protection mechanism, and potentially deliver executable attachments to the mailboxes of end users.

## How does this detection method work?

Versions through 4.97.1 are vulnerable to this vulnerability. This template version matches for any instances of Exim prior to and including 4.87.1.

## How do I run this script?

2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
